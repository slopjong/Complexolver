Solve MathML inefficiently by using string substitutions as follows:

1. stripping all whitespaces
2. finding atomar apply nodes, if none found stop
3. evaluating the atomar apply nodes
4. replacing the atomar apply nodes with the calculation result
5. jump to 2

Don't use this algorithm in productive code :-)
