Solve MathML inefficiently by using string substitutions as follows:

1. stripping all whitespaces
2. finding atomar apply nodes, if none found found
3. evaluating the atomar apply nodes
4. replacing the atomar apply nodes in the XML text with the calculation result
5. jump to 2

Don't use this algorithm in productive code :-)

Update:
------------
Finally I don't use string substitutions but process the formula
recursively and thus nothing became as inefficient as I claimed.
